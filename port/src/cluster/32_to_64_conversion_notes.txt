Conversion Notes

General Idea:

Replace most primitives with declarations from STDINT.H

Identify the variables types that don't convert well between the two architectures:




Direct variable type conversion chart:
	- short	-> 	int16_t
	- int 	->	int16_t
	- long	->	int32_t
	
Other conversions:
	- sizeof(unsigned long) ->	sizeof(int32_t)  <-- valid  because the two types have the same size in bits
